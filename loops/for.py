# Basic example of implementing a for-loop

# Create a variable called count to hold the current count
count = 1
print x

# For loop
# for [variable] in range (start amount, stop amount, increment amount)
for count in range(1, 12, 1):
	# Add 1 to count and print the result
	count = count + 1
	print count
